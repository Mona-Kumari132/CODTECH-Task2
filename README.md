This typically includes current conditions, forecasts, severe weather alerts, and sometimes additional features like radar maps.

Key Activities:

•Customizable Alerts: Notifications for severe weather or significant changes.

•User Engagement: Features like weather-related news, tips, or community interactions.

•Personalization: Tailored forecasts based on user location and preferences.

•Integration: Compatibility with other apps or devices for a seamless experience.

•Educational Content: Information about weather patterns and phenomena.

Technologies Used:

•HTML: For structuring the app’s content and layout.

•CSS: For styling and designing the user interface.

•JavaScript: For dynamic functionality, such as fetching weather data from APIs, handling user interactions, and updating the UI.
